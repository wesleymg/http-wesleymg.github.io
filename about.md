Hi! I'm Wes! I'm a first year software engineering student at Michigan Technological University. I'm an avid fan of open source technology, home automation, gaming, and DIY technology. On my Github, linked below, you can find the current work I'm doing on my open source home automation system. My blog is also attached, where I work on DIY projects.
### More Information

While I would love to post on this more, being a college student, involved in extra curriculars and an AFROTC cadet, which leaves me strapped for cash and time, so I'll post when I can, but it probably won't be regular. Thanks for understanding.
