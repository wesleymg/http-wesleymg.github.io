Hi! I'm Wes! I'm a third year computer science student at Indiana University Kokomo. I'm an avid fan of open source technology, home automation, gaming, and DIY technology. On my Github you can see the code of all of my projects discussed here. Otherwise, you can find my discussions on all of my projects here to learn more.
### More Information

My current projects are a home automation system and a smart recipe book. You can click the blog button above to see all of my posts.
